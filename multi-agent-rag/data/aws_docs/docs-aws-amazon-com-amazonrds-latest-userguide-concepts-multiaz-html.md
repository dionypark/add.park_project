# Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon RDS

<!-- 출처: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html -->

Multi-AZ deployments can have one standby or two standby DB instances. When the deployment
has one standby DB instance, it's called a *Multi-AZ DB instance
deployment*. A Multi-AZ DB instance deployment has one standby DB instance
that provides failover support, but doesn't serve read traffic. When the deployment has
two standby DB instances, it's called a *Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment*.
A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment has standby DB instances that provide failover support and
can also serve read traffic.

You can use the AWS Management Console to determine whether a Multi-AZ deployment is a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment or a Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment.
In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then choose a **DB identifier**.

-
A Multi-AZ DB instance deployment has the following characteristics:

-
There is only one row for the DB instance.

-
The value of

**Role**is**Instance**or**Primary**. -
The value of

**Multi-AZ**is**Yes**.

-
-
A Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment has the following characteristics:

-
There is a cluster-level row with three DB instance rows under it.

-
For the cluster-level row, the value of

**Role**is**Multi-AZ DB cluster**. -
For each instance-level row, the value of

**Role**is**Writer instance**or**Reader instance**. -
For each instance-level row, the value of

**Multi-AZ**is**3 Zones**.

-

In addition, the following topics apply to both DB instances and Multi-AZ DB clusters.
